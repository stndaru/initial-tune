# Game Polishing
In this chance, no polishing was made. This is due to the fact that the game was already made fully polished, and that no additional polishing is required. Any forced polishment will require major effort that is unfortunately not possible given the timeframe.    
Code polishing is also not possible due to the given timeframe and the complex dependancy between scenes, thus no polishing was made.
